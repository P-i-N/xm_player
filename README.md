# xm_player
XM module player written in Rust from scratch.

It's does not implement the full XM specification (whatever that means), but hey! It _sort of_ plays `Hybrid Song` and that's good enough.

## What do:
1) `cargo build`
2) run `target/debug/xm_player.exe`, it automaticaly plays `song.xm` from working directory
3) listen to the soothing melodies
